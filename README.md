Theprojectfocusesonthedevelopmentofanautonomous  system for harvesting radishes, combining a robotic arm and a com puter vision system.


The system identifies and locates ripe radishes
 using cameras and vision algorithms, determining their exact posi
tion for UFactory’s Lite6 robotic arm to pick them without damaging
 them. The arm is mounted on the front of an autonomous vehicle
 (AGV) chassis, while the cameras and Raspberry Pi are installed
 in a protective case tilted at 45°, optimizing visual coverage. The
 system has proven to be technically feasible and efficient, enabling
 accurate and autonomous radish harvesting, improving agricultural
 productivity and reducing human intervention
